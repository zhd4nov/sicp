; section 1.2.2 (./examples/money-change.rkt) in making change for 11 cents. What are the orders of 
; growth of the space and number of steps used by this process as the amount to be changed increases?

; The algorithm is greedy type
; Order of growth for space is O(n)
; Order of growth for time. This recursion is hard to solve analytically. It seems like O(n^2) ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
