; native if is a special form but new-if is a primitive procedure.
; due to applicative order of evaluation interpreter will try to evaluate all of arguments at first
; in the new-if case recursion won't end but in the case of a special form sqrt-iter
; works â€“ parameters will be evaluate in every step, in one moment.
